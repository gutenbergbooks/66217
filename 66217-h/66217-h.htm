Literary Journalism in Chicago

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">N</span><span class="postfirstchar">othing</span> succeeds like an indiscretion. I was indiscreet enough last
winter to speak my mind (a little of it) about <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>, <em>The
Dial</em>, <em>Poetry</em>, <em>The Drama</em>, and the audience to which these papers appeal.
The result is that I have been flattered or intimidated into speaking it ever
since. In the present instance both methods have been used most charmingly—and
shamelessly. You see, Miss Anderson and I live in the same village.
And yet I said nothing, and have nothing to say about any paper except what
everybody knows.
</p>

<p>
Everybody knows that <em>The Friday Literary Review</em> of <em>The Chicago
Evening Post</em> under Mr. Francis Hackett and, later, under Mr. Floyd Dell
gave us the most alert, the most eager, the most intelligent, and the best-written
discussion of literature in the United States. That eight-page supplement
did what had hardly been done west of England before: it made book
reviews worth reading. There was almost as much difference between the
<em>Friday Review</em> and <em>The Dial</em> as there is between Mr. George Bernard Shaw
and Mr. Nicholas Murray Butler, almost as much difference between the
<em>Friday Review</em> and <em>The New York Times Literary Supplement</em> as there is
between M. Anatole France and Mr. Henry Van Dyke. There was good
writing in the <em>Friday Review</em> and good thinking behind it. It was almost
never dull; and if it was young it was not wholly unsophisticated; and if it
was sometimes dead wrong it was not stupid. If there were half as many
persons interested in the discussion of ideas as most of us like to believe
the <em>Friday Review</em> would inevitably have continued. It would, that’s all.
But as things are it was fated. Neither the mechanics nor the economics
of daily journalism permitted it. The <em>Post</em> could not continue to give us—it
quite literally gave us—eight pages of what so few of us wanted so much.
</p>

<p>
Everybody knows that if a weekly paper dealing not only with literature
but with all the other arts in the spirit and with the journalistic competence
of the <em>Friday Review</em> were established in Chicago everybody would have
to read it.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-2" class="pagenum" title="2"></a>
That is the point I wished to make. It is perfectly obvious that <span class="smallcaps">The
Little Review</span> is not the kind of newspaper of the arts I have in mind.
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> is published only once a month. It is therefore not a
newspaper, but a magazine. It is three times as good as <em>The Drama</em>, which
is published only once a quarter. But my point is that we ought to have
something four times as good as <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>: in short, a weekly.
It may be that <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> has other failings than its infrequency.
But why consider these lesser matters? <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> has one virtue
in addition to its eagerness. It is informal. Informality is the breath of
life to journalism. Nobody can write anything the way people want him
to unless he feels perfectly free to write the way he wants to. It is far
more a matter of manners than a matter of truth. A journal which insists
on formality almost never has any good writing in it. Good writing is
nothing but the artistic expression of a personality. Scientifically speaking,
it can be nothing else. Not that one must be thinking about expressing his
personality in order to write well. The very point is that he must not be
thinking about it. He has got to be thinking about what he has to say and
nothing else. Take the use of “I” as an apparently trivial but actually significant
example. If the paper for which he is writing regards the use of
“I” as a breach of good form a man will find that one finger of his left
hand is mysteriously drawn to the shift key and one finger of his right hand
to the key between the “u” and the “o” in order to make an “I” all the time
he is punching his typewriter. The least excusable riot of “I’s” I ever saw
in print was in a journal of literary discussion which believes in the reality
of that invention of the old-fashioned logician, “objective criticism,” and
which regards the use of “I” by any but elderly gentlemen of the walnuts
and wine school as impossible. I did it myself in the absence of the editor.
In a paper which does not in the least object to the use of “I” writers soon
forget all about it, and when they do that they begin to use it only when it
is effective. It is the virtue of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> that it permits its contributors
to use “I” as often as they please; that it permits them to make
fools of themselves occasionally. This means that it is not impossible to
write well for <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. I do not say that it is not possible to
write badly for <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. Perfect freedom to be idiotic does not
inevitably eliminate idiocy.
</p>

<p>
But I have no more compliments for <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>.

<em>Poetry</em> is another matter. Miss Monroe’s magazine has printed some
bad verse. But this is not, as its most envious critics imagine, its distinction.
Every magazine prints bad verse. <em>Poetry</em> has printed poetry that nobody
else dared to print. <em>Poetry</em> has boldly discussed the poetic controversy when
everybody else hid behind language. <em>Poetry</em> introduced us to Rabindranath
Tagore, to Vachel Lindsay, in a way, to Edgar Lee Masters. <em>Poetry</em>
printed Ford Hueffer’s poem <em>On Heaven</em>. <em>Poetry</em> has heard of Remy de
Gourmont and the <em>Mercure de France</em>—an incredible achievement for a Chicago
<a id="page-3" class="pagenum" title="3"></a>
literary journal. <em>Poetry</em> has done more than any other paper to furnish
a meeting ground for writers in Chicago. If <em>Poetry</em> were concerned
about novels it would not decide two or three years after intelligent people
had discovered <em>Jean Christophe</em> that M. Romain Rolland is a successor to
Tolstoi and, for the first time, print a few paragraphs about him. If <em>Poetry</em>
were interested in psychology it would not ignore Sigmund Freud and Carl
Jung. But <em>Poetry</em> is not interested in these things. Its great wealth is
devoted only to poetry and it comes out only once a month.
</p>

<p>
It is a pity. For the spirit of <em>Poetry</em> is nearer to the spirit of the old
<em>Friday Literary Review</em> than anything else in Chicago. That is the spirit
I like, that seems suited to the place and the occasion. But it needs a weekly
paper of wide scope to express itself.

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span> little girl of eleven was working here in the study through the long
forenoon. In the midst of it, we each looked up and out through the
barred window to the nearest elm, where a song-sparrow had just finished a
perfect expression of the thing as he felt it. The song was more elaborate,
perhaps, because the morning was lofty and glorious. Old Mother Nature
smelled like a tea-rose that morning; one would know from that without
the sense of direction that the wind was from the south. The song from
the sunlight among the new elm leaves was so joyous that it choked us. It
stood out from all the songs of the morning, because it was so near, and
we had each been called by it from the pleasant mystery of our tasks.
</p>

<p>
The little girl leaned toward the window. We heard the other bird
answer from the distance, and then <em>ours</em> sang again—and again. We sipped
the ecstacy in the hushes. Like a flicker the little bird was gone—a leaning
forward on the branch, and then a blur ... and presently the words
in the room:
</p>

<div class="poem-container">
  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
    <p class="verse">“... sang four songs and flew away.”</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">
It was a word-portrait, and told me much that I wanted. The number,
of course, was not mental, clearly a part of the inner impression. However,
no explanation will help if the art of the saying is not apparent. I
told the thing as it is here, to a class later in the day, and a woman said:
</p>

<p>
“Why, those six words make a Japanese poem.”
</p>

<p>
I wonder if it is oriental? Rather I think it belongs especially to our
new generation, the elect of which seems to know innately that an expression
of truth in itself is a master-stroke. Somehow the prison-house has not
closed altogether upon the elect of the new generation. There are lines in
the new poetry that could come forth, and have their being, only from the
<a id="page-6" class="pagenum" title="6"></a>
inner giant that heretofore has been asleep except in the hearts of the rarest
few whose mothers mated with Gods, merely using men for a symbol and
the gift of matter....
</p>

<p>
As I believe that the literary generation which has the floor in America
today is the weakest and the bleakest that ever made semi-darkness of good
sunlight, so I believe that the elect of the new generation contains individuals
who are true heaven-borns; that they bring their own light with
them and do not stand about stretched for reflection; that they refuse to
allow the world-lie to shut the passages of power within them, between the
zone of dreams and the more temperate zones of matter. They have refused
to accept us—that is the splendid truth.
</p>

<p>
The new generation does not argue with us. They are not a race of
talkers. They do not accept what they find and begin to build upon that,
as all but the masters have done heretofore. They are making even their
own footings and abutments. And to such clean and sure beginnings magic
strength has come. The fashions and the mannerisms which we knew and
thought of as the heart of things; the artfulness of speech and written word,
the age of advertising which twisted its lie into the very physical structure
of our brains; the countless reserves and covers to hide our want of inspiration
(for light cannot pass through a twisted passage)—all these, the new
age has put away. It meets life face to face—and a more subtle and formidable
devil is required for its workers than that which seduced us.
</p>

<p>
The few great workmen heretofore have come up in the lie, and in
midlife, the sutures closing—they were warned because they had labored like
men. For their work’s sake and for their religion, which is the same to
great men, they perceived that they must tear the lie out of their hearts,
even if they bled to death. We call it their illumination, but it was a very
deep and dark passage for them. <em>Except that ye become as little children</em>—that
was all they knew, perhaps, but quite enough.... And the old
masters invariably put their story down for us to read: Rodin, Puvis de
Chavannes, Whitman, Balzac, Tolstoi—only to mention a little group of
the nearer names—all have told the story. In their later years they told
no other story.
</p>

<p>
In the beginning they served men, as they fancied men wanted to be
served, but after they confronted the lie of it, they dared to listen to reality
from their own nature. They fought the fight for that cosmic simplicity
which is the natural flowering of the child mind, and which modern education
patronizingly dresses down at every appearance. The masters wrenched
open with all their remaining strength the doors of the prison-house, and
become more and more like children unto the end.

... I do not ask a finer fate than to write about the <em>New Age</em>
and <em>Children</em> and <em>Education by Children</em> for <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. I think
of <em>you</em> as one of its throbbing centers. I can say it better than that—I
<a id="page-7" class="pagenum" title="7"></a>
think of you as a brown Arabian tent in which the world’s desire is just
rousing from sleep. I would like to be one of the larks of the morning,
whose song makes it impossible for you to doze again. I would not come
too near—lest you find me old, the brandings of past upon me. Yet because
of the years, I think I know what will be that “more formidable
and subtle devil” waiting to make you forget your way.
</p>

<p>
He is not a stranger. He is always near when people dare to be simple.
There are many who call him a God still, but they do not use their eyes.
You who see so directly must never forget that bad curve of him below
the shoulders. Forever, the artists lying to themselves have tried to cover
that bad curve of Pan as it sweeps down into the haunches of a goat. Pan
is the first devil you meet when you reach that rectitude of heart which
dares to be naked and unashamed.
</p>

<p>
Whole races of artists have lied about Pan because they listened to the
haunting music of his pipes. It calls sweetly, but does not satisfy. How
many Pan has called—and left them sitting among the rocks with mindless
eyes and hands that fiddle with emptiness!... Pan is so sad and level-eyed.
He does not explain. He does not promise—too wise for that. He
lures and enchants. He makes you pity him with a pity that is red as the
lusts of flesh.
</p>

<p>
You know that red in the breast! It is the red that drives away the
dream of peace, yet the pity of him deludes you. You look again and again,
and the curve of his back does not break the dream, as before. You think
that because you pity him, you cannot fall; and all the pull of the ground
tells you that your <em>very thought of falling</em> is a breath from the old shames—your
dead, but as yet unburied heritage, from generations that learned the
lie to itself.
</p>

<p>
You touch the hair of the goat, and say it is Nature. But Pan is not
Nature—a hybrid, half of man’s making, rather. Your eyes fall to the
cloven hoof, but return to the level steady eye, smiling with such soft sadness
that your heart quickens for him, and you listen, as he says: “All
Gods have animal bodies and cloven hoofs, but I alone have dared to reveal
mine.” ... “How brave you are!” Your heart answers, and the throb
of him bewilders you with passion.... You who are so high must
fall far, when you let go.
</p>

<p>
... And many of you will want to fall. Pan has come to you
because you <em>dare</em>.... You have murdered the old shames, you have
torn down the ancient and mouldering churches. You do not require the
blood, the thorn, the spikes, but I wonder if even you of a glorious generation,
do not still require the Cross?... It is because you see so surely
and are level-eyed that Pan is back in the world for you; and it is very
strange but true that you must first meet Pan and pass him by, before you
can enter into the woodlands with that valid God of Nature, whose back
is a challenge to aspiration, and whose feet are of the purity of the saints.

You remember the story of the king parading every morning before
his meek subjects who expressed their great admiration for the sovereign’s
gorgeous raiment, until a certain simpleton shouted: “Why, the king is
nude!” I do not recall the end of the story, nor how the impudent sceptic
was punished; but the part I do remember recurs to me every time
some elemental power comes along and sweeps away the ephemeral figments
from the body of mankind. Mars has more than once played the part of
the rude simpleton; this god has neither tact nor manners; with his heavy
boot he dots the i’s and compels us to name pigs pigs. His first victim falls
the frail web of diplomatic niceties. Talleyrand’s cynicism about the function
of the diplomat’s tongue to conceal truth has become bankrupt: who
takes seriously nowadays the casuistry of the manicolored Books issued by
the belligerents? Even Tartuffian England has had to doff the robe of
idealism and to admit through the <em>Times</em> that it would have fought regardless
of whether the neutrality of Belgium had been infringed upon or
not. Good. One of the salutary results of the war (let us hope there will
be more than one good result) has already been realized in the wholesale unmasquing
of international politics; it will do immense good for mankind-Caliban

The United States holds fast to its tradition of lagging behind the rest
of the world. Messrs. Wilson and Bryan still employ the rusty weapon of
“putting one over” through transparent bluff. “Too proud to fight” has
become a classic <em>mot</em> the world over, to the sheer delight of European
humorists and cartoonists after their wits had been exhausted over the
memorable “Watchful Waiting.” The admirable English of the President
has demonstrated its effectiveness time and again: nearly each eloquent
Note has been responded to by a German torpedo. “America asks nothing
for herself but what she has a right to ask for humanity itself”—what
obsolete verbosity! Who is this Mme. Humanity in whose name we demand
the right to send shells to Europe unhampered by the intended victims of
those shells? An American weekly, outspokenly pro-British, has cynically
<a id="page-10" class="pagenum" title="10"></a>
summed up the situation: “The British government will not allow a German
woman to obtain food from the United States with which to feed her children,
in spite of the fact that it is buying rifles in the United States with
which to kill her husband.” We can neither blame England for her practical
purposes, nor reproach the United States for her desire to accommodate a
good customer: business is business; but why these appeals in the name
of humanity? Why the indignant outcries against Germany’s successful
attempts to check the supply of ammunition for her enemies? The brutal
Lusitania affair has merely proved the consistent and consequential policy
of Germany; had she not carried out her threats she would have found
herself in the ridiculous position of our government which seldom goes
beyond threats. Talk about the murder of women and children in time
of war! I heard of a polite Frenchman who hurled himself from the top
story of the Masonic Temple and removed his hat to apologize before a
lady on one of the balconies whose hat he happened to brush on his downward
flight. Well, the Germans are not polite.
</p>

<p>
What is the significance of Mr. Bryan’s resignation? Let us hope it
is of no import; let us hope it may cause a change in tone, but not in action.
For this country to be dragged into the whirlpool of the world war would
be a more unpardonable folly than the puerile Vera Cruz affair. Our entrance
into the war would change the actual situation of the fighting powers
as much as the solemn declaration of war by the Liliputian San Marino
has changed it; in the absence of an army deserving mention we could depend
solely upon our navy which would be able to accomplish nothing more
than joining in some calm bay the invincible fleet of the Ruler of the Waves
and indulge in philosophical watchful waiting. On the other hand official
war against Germany will doubtless produce internal friction of the gravest
importance. I say <em>official</em>, for unofficially we have been on the side of the
Allies for many months despite our theoretical neutrality. Think of the
sentiments of the German soldiers when they are showered upon with shells
bearing the labels of American manufacturers. Had we not supplied England
and France with ammunition, who knows but that they would have
found themselves in the same predicament as Russia, that is, in the position
of an orchestra without instruments? When we shall have declared war
against Germany we shall hardly be in power to harm her more than we
have done heretofore; the Allies will do the killing, and we, the manufacturing.
But the cat’s-paw-game is ungentlemanly, especially when it is done
officially. To be sure, Mr. Wilson is a gentleman; hence our firm hope that
he will do nothing more grave than enriching English literature with exemplary
Notography.

In his Frankfurt letters Heine wrote:

I have never felt inclined to repose confidence in Prussia.
I have rather been filled with anxiety as I gazed upon this Prussian
eagle, and while others boasted of the bold way in which he glared
<a id="page-11" class="pagenum" title="11"></a>
at the sun my attention was drawn more and more to his claws.
I never trusted this Prussian, this tall canting hero in gaiters, with
his big paunch and his large jaws, and his corporal’s stick, which
he dips in holy water before he lays it about your back. I am not
overfond of this philosophical Christian militarism, this hodge-podge
of thin beer, lies, and sand. I utterly loathe this Prussia,
this stiff, hypocritical, sanctimonious Prussia, this Tartuffe among
the nations.
</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">
Can you blame Wilhelm for opposing the erection of a Heine monument
in Düsseldorf? Those lines were written nearly four scores of years
ago, a time sufficient for turning epithets obsolete. No longer is Prussia
labeled hypocritical and sanctimonious; it is rather accused of rude frankness
and insulting tactlessness. Yet the hatred for Prussia has not abated,
but has been greatly enhanced. Heine died before the planting of the
atrocious Sieges-Allee, that symbol of the triumphant pig; it is in the last
forty years that the world has witnessed the development of Prussian forbearance,
narrowness, machine-like preciseness, and soullessness. We have
always preferred to distinguish Germany from Prussia; we have found
delight in the thought that there is a Munich as well as a Berlin, a Nietzsche
as well as a Haeckel, a Rheinhard as well as a Bernhardi.... Today we
witness the hegemony of Prussia, a hegemony political as well as spiritual,
for the great war has crowned with triumph not only the Krupp guns but
also the Prussian idea of efficiency and preciseness. Our amazement at the
achievements of the lightning-like army that has been almost invariably victorious
during the eleven months of fighting and has held in its iron grip
two hostile fronts, and our astonishment at the diabolical accomplishment
of the submarines which have driven the English fleet to rest in North
Scotland and have become the Flying Dutchmen of the seas, pale before our
admiration for the wonderful spirit displayed by the German people within
their country. Read their press; you find nothing bombastic or boasting,
but calm reserve, set teeth, clenched fists, and deadly determination to fight
for life, even if it be a fight against the whole world. “<em><a id="corr-4"></a>Weder Schlafpulver
noch Tonics!</em>” admonishes Maximilian Harden against drumming up illusionary
hopes. “<em>Stirb und werde</em>,” he closes up one of his terse articles in the
most virile publication I know of, the <em>Zukunft</em>. Bernhardi’s alternative—a
World Power or Downfall—is not any longer a mere jingo-rocket but an
imperative axiom uniting all Germans in a desperate decision to preserve
their national existence in face of a universal hatred and complete isolation.
They are not geniuses, those perseverant Teutons; rather are they the reverse
of geniuses. They do not rise above reality; they adapt themselves to
facts. They refuse to be Quixotic knights; they prefer to emulate Mahomet
who went to the mountain when the mountain declined to go unto him; not
to ride on the back of conditions and circumstances, but to hold tight their
tail and be dragged after them. Herein lies the Teutonic victory, the victory
of Blond Beast over Superman, the triumph of mediocrity over uniqueness,
of fact over idea, of efficiency over idealism, of state over individual.

Arthur Rimbaud, the close friend of Verlaine, the “ruffian,” according
to Mr. Powys (this I shall never forgive him), was capable not only of
perceiving the color of vowels but also of foreseeing the political situation
forty-five years ahead. <em>L’Eclaireur de Nice</em> prints an interesting statement
made by Rimbaud in 1871, a few lines of which I shall reluctantly attempt
to translate:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
The Germans are by far our inferiors, for the vainer a people
is the closer it approaches decadence—history proves it.... They
are our inferiors because victory has besotted them. Our chauvinism
has received a blow from which it will not recover. The defeat
has freed us from stupid prejudice, has transformed and saved us.
Yes, they will pay dearly for their victory! In fifty years envious
and restless Europe will prepare for them a bold unexpected stroke,
and will whip them. I can foresee the administration of iron and
folly that will stifle German society and German thought, in the

given cause for suspecting him of pro-German sentiments. In a recent interview
with the correspondent of the Paris <em>Journal</em> the Danish critic avows his
full sympathy for France. Although his statement is reserved and plausibly
neutral, one easily discerns his dislike for Germany, in whose <em>Deutschland
über Alles</em> motto he sees a Jesuitic excuse for all means that may lead to
her end. “German brutality is not instinctive; it is a scientific one, a theory.”
The cause of the war he epitomizes in the <em>mot</em> of Pascal: “Pourquoi voulez
vous tuer cette homme?”—“Il est mon ennemi: il habite de l’autre côté du
fleuve.” Brandes expresses himself more frankly in the Danish <em>Tilskueren</em>,
where he interprets the war as the struggle between liberalism and personal
government, between civil spirit and militarism, between a people (England)
which accords others commercial freedom and self-government and a country
overridden with economic protectionism, junkers, and bureaucracy.
“England has an independent press and a government which voices the
parliament and public opinion; in Germany the press is semi-official, the
government is responsible solely before the Kaiser, and the Kaiser only
before God.”

<em>Germanophobia ad Absurdum</em>

<p class="noindent">
The French Immortals, too old for actual participation in the war,
have found an outlet for their patriotism in shedding red ink of ridiculous
<a id="page-13" class="pagenum" title="13"></a>
chauvinism. It has become a matter of course to meet a name of some
“Membre de l’Academie” signed under such outbursts as this: “Nothing
of the Barbarians, nothing of their literature, of their music, of their art,
of their science, nothing of their culture, of anything Made in Germany!”
Another Academic gives vent to his ire against those Frenchmen who still
find certain German things worth admiring, and he vehemently advocates the
prohibition of the Barbarian music and art “by law, by persuasion, by force,
by violence if necessary!” The octogenarian Saint-Saens has written a
series of articles venomously attacking Wagnerian music, labeling traitor
any Frenchman who favors the art of the arch-foe of his country. Even
the semi-official <em>Le Temps</em> was shocked by the violent tone of the old composer;
it quoted Saint-Saens’s articles of the year 1876, in which the author
appeared to be an ardent Wagnerite and appealed to his compatriots for
broad-mindedness and toleration for “the greatest genius of our times.”
As a substitute for the atrocious Wagner Saint-Saens recommends the
return to Haydn and Mozart, even to Meyerbeer; Schumann’s Lieder he
would ban for Gounod and Massenet; he favors even Dussek, for he is
“only a Bohemian.” Patriotic as he is, he refuses to sanction the modern
French composers, since Debussy, Fauré, D’Indy, and the rest are Wagnerians
in his estimation. It is a case of “senile reactionarism,” as the <em>Mercure
de France</em> rightly observes.

<em>Comparative Morale</em>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
It is very interesting to compare the barometer of public morale in
the European capitals, judging from their amusements. Here is one day’s
bill taken from the London <em>Daily News</em>, the Petrograd <em>Ryech</em>, the <em>Berliner
Tageblatt</em>, the Vienna <em>Neue Freie Presse</em>, and the Paris <em>Figaro</em>; I have
omitted the movies, which bear for the most part ultra-patriotic titles, and
the vaudevilles. The London bill is quite poor: <em>Veronique</em>, a comic opera;
<em>Mme. Sans-Gene</em>; Gaby Deslys in <em>Rosy Rapture</em>, presented by Charles
Frohman; <em>The Girl in the Taxi</em>; Frondai’s <em>The Right to Kill</em>; <em>For England,
Home, and Beauty</em>; and our old friends, the Irish Players, in the Little
Theatre. Still more meager is the Paris bill: outside of <em>Cavalleria Rusticana</em>
(the chairman of the Walt Whitman dinner pronounces it Keyveleeria
Rohstikeyna), it abounds with such tit-bits as <em>La Petite Fonctionaire</em>,
<em>Mam’zelle Boy Scout</em>, <em>Mariage de Pepeta</em>, and so forth. Berlin has on that
day three operas—<em>Don Juan</em>, <em>Elektra</em>, <em>Lohengrin</em>; three dramas—<em>Faust</em>,
<em>Peer Gynt</em>, <em>Schluck und Jau</em> (the last one in Rheinhard’s Deutsches Theater),
not counting the minor affairs. Vienna’s bill took away my breath: a Schönberg-Mahler
Abend, a Schubert-Strauss Abend, a Beethoven-Brahms Abend,
a Brahms Kammermusik Abend, a concert under Sevcik; <em>Carmen</em>; a play by
Fulda after Molière; Ibsen’s <em>Master Builder</em> and <em>Ghosts</em>; Kleist’s <em>Kätchen
von Heilbronn</em>. As for the Petrograd bill, I had better not say what emotions
it has aroused in me. Judge for yourselves: five operas—<em>Traviata</em>,
<em>Faust</em>, <em>Pagliacci</em>, <em>Ruslan and Ludmilla</em>, <em>Eugene Onegin</em>; a ballet by Mlle.
<a id="page-14" class="pagenum" title="14"></a>
Krzesinsky; two ballets by Fokin’s company; plays by Ibsen, Mirbo, Andreyev,
beside <em>Potash and Perlmutter</em> and other importations; an exhibition of
paintings by Lancerè and Dobuzhinsky; a Poeso-Evening by Futurist poets
with Igor Severyanin as leader; an Evening of Poetry under K. R. (Grand
Duke Konstantine, whose play <em>King of the Jews</em> recently appeared in an
English translation); public lectures on <em>The Blue Bird</em> in Our Days, on
Dostoevsky and Nietzsche.... Allow me to stop. Are you inclined
to draw conclusions and comparisons between the stage of war-ridden
Europe and that of peacefully complacent America? I beg to be excused.

<em>The Downfall of the International</em>
</h3>

<p class="noindent">
Another result of the war, already sufficiently crystallized, is the bankruptcy
of the illusionary spirit of internationalism. In his remarkable book<a class="fnote" href="#footnote-1" id="fnote-1">[1]</a>
Mr. Walling has taken the trouble of quoting resolutions of national sections
of the Socialist party the world over, before and during the war.
<a id="page-17" class="pagenum" title="17"></a>
With a few significant exceptions the Socialists of the warring nations
have had to exchange their erstwhile slogan “Workers of the world, be
united!” for the less noble motto “Defend your country!” Even when the
European armies had already been mobilized the Socialists held protest meetings
at which they threatened to call a general strike if war should be
declared. But with the first cannon boom the theoretic brotherhood evaporated
and gave way to patriotic sentiments. The workers declared that
they were Germans, Russians, etc., first, then Socialists. True, in the beginning
the German Socialists claimed that they were fighting against the
reactionary Czardom, while the Socialists of the Allies tried to justify the
international carnage as the struggle against Prussian militarism; but ultimately
such clear-headed thinkers as Kautsky and some of the English
Socialists came to see the futility of endeavoring to discover idealistic
causes for the mutual slaughter. The country is in danger, consequently
we must defend it, regardless of the rightness or wrongness of its policy—this
is the prevailing sentiment among the workers. The grandiose structure
of the International has fallen in ruins; the “scientific” theories and
calculations of the Marxians have received a blow by the underestimated
imponderabilia, that of primitive patriotism. On the other hand, “applied”
Socialism has won a considerable victory with the development of the war.
Nearly all the belligerent countries have adopted State-Socialism in such
measures as the nationalization of railways and means of production. The
capitalists are evidently shrewd enough to utilize the doctrines of their
opponents in time of need and thus to neutralize the sting of that very
opposition. What will become of Socialism when at least its minimum-program
is accepted and put into practice by the <em>capitalistic</em> order without
the aid of a social revolution, the inevitability of which has been scientifically
proven by Marx and his disciples?

</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar"><span class="prefirstchar">“</span>P</span><span class="postfirstchar">eople”</span> has become to me a word that—crawls. If you have ever
heard Mr. Bryan pronounce it you will know what I mean. He
says it “peo-pul”....
</p>

<p>
And that is the way they act. Sometimes I see peo-pul in this kind of
picture: a cosmic squirming mass of black caterpillars moving first one
way and then the other, slowly and vaguely, not like measuring worms who
cover the ground or like ants who have their definite business, but heavily,
blindly, in the stunned manner peculiar to caterpillar organisms. They peer
and poke and nod and ponder and creep and crawl and scramble and grow
dizzy and turn around and around, wondering whether they shall go on
the way they started or go back the way they came or refuse to go at all.
Once in a hundred years one of the caterpillars breaks his skin and flies
away—a butterfly through the unfriendly air. Then the black mass writhes
in protest and arranges that the next butterfly shall have his wings well
clipped. I know my metaphor is not scientifically intact, but what does it
matter? It satisfies my impulse—which is simply to call names. So I might
as well say “People are caterpillars” and be done with it.
</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="noindent">
I have a painter artist friend who says that to talk about the artist in life
is simply to repeat one of those silly phrases that mean nothing. But it means
entirely too much, I think—which is the reason there are so many of the
species in evidence: about two in a million perhaps—and I know that is
far too optimistic. That would mean some four or five thousand people in
the living world who have nothing in common with caterpillars. The count
is too high!
</p>

<p>
For really there are no artists among us. Living picturesquely, artistically,
has nothing to do with being an artist in life; and even living with
the poise that marks a good piece of art hasn’t necessarily anything to do
with it. If you ask me to choose a type of the real artist in life I shall say
Nietzsche rather than Goethe. For the artist in life has inevitably to do
with prophecy rather than with holding up the mirror; and that means
chiefly—to have strength!
</p>

<p>
Now where are the strong people? Of course “strength” is an indefinite
term. Sometimes it seems a matter of dominating the superfluous; sometimes
it seems the power “to meet fate with an equal gaze”; and sometimes
the resource or the daring to push one’s fate to a farther goal. But
these are beginnings! If you pick up what is known as your soul from a
<a id="page-19" class="pagenum" title="19"></a>
wreckage and make it march on you think you are very strong. If you
manage to make it march with pride and joy you think you are a Superman.
But this is easily within the effort of Everyman. I am talking of artists
now and of the radiant possibility that such beings may develop in this uninspired
land; and, in these terms, to be strong is to help create the farther
goal!
</p>

<p>
It’s disgusting to realize that the people we know are not this sort.
Take any twenty of your friends and classify them briefly as types. Perhaps
there are five who have “personality”: but one of them has no energy,
one no will, one no brains, one no imagination, and the other no “spirit;”
there are five who have “intellect”: one of them has no “character,” one
no strength, one can’t see or hear or feel, one sees so inclusively that he has
no goal, and one sees so “straight” that he misses the road on both sides;
there are five who have a capacity for art: one is lazy, one is ignorant, one
is afraid, one is vain, one has a lie in him; and there are five who have a
capacity for living: one can’t think, one can’t work, one can’t persevere, one
can’t stand alone, one wastes his gift on others and never realizes himself.
You can work out such combinations <em>ad infinitum</em> and you can excuse them to
the same distance by calling it all a matter of having the defects of your
qualities. Why not call it a matter of having the complacency of your
defects?
</p>

<p>
If you’ve not got imagination you can’t help it; if you’ve not got
strength you can get it. It won’t make you an artist but it will make it
impossible for you to be confused with the caterpillars. If you’ve got a
vision—an Idea—and can find the strength to fly toward it you’ll be an
artist in life. This is not to confuse the artist with the prophet. You can’t
very well do that because the terms are so interdependent. There has never
been an artist without the prophet in him, and there has never been a
prophet who was not an artist. It’s a different thing if you’re talking about
priests or about inferior artists. And then of course you have to remember
that there are no such things as inferior artists. Priest and demagogue
are the names for those who fail as prophets or as artists.
</p>

<p>
And what is the use of such a harangue? There is very little use.
People won’t be artists. Peo-pul don’t change. But the individual changes,
and that is the hope. Individuals are persons who can stand alone. There
ought to be Individuals coming out of a generation brought up on Nietzsche.
Such an upbringing has taught us at least two things: first that he who
goes forward goes alone, and second that it is weakness rather than nobility
to succumb to the caterpillars. Yes, and something else: that it is
from superabundance rather than from hunger that creation comes. We
start out fortified with all this. We don’t need to wrestle with our gods
every time the old laws threaten to submerge us; our universe doesn’t
totter when the caterpillars groan that we will be lonely if we go alone or
hurt if we are misunderstood or tragic if we don’t compromise. We don’t
mind these things.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-20" class="pagenum" title="20"></a>
It really all comes to one end: Life for Art’s sake. We believe in that
because it is the only way to get more Life—a finer quality, a higher vibration.
This bigger concept doesn’t mean merely more Beauty. It means
more Intensity. In short, it means the <em>New</em> Hellenism. And that is a step
beyond the old Greek ideal of proportion and moderation. It pushes forward
to the superabundance that dares abandonment.

Slobberdom, Sneerdom, and Boredom

<span class="firstchar">I</span><span class="postfirstchar">t</span> is the custom of inspired opinion to pay little attention to mediocrities,
to dismiss them with a shudder. I understand <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> to be
an embodiment of inspired opinion, an abandonment of mental emotion—Youth.
Like some of the people who read it and even some of them who
write for it, it flies at the throats of contemporary Chimeras and leaps upon
the Pegasi of the moment. It slashes and roars, hates and loves. It never
considers the right and never considers the wrong. It does not endeavor
to be just and fair. This is at once a great crime and a great virtue. It is
criminal to be unjust and it is virtuous to be truthful. To me <span class="smallcaps">The Little
Review</span> is always both. I sympathize with its spirit and share it. Leave
justice to the greybeards. Why should a soul which has the capacity for
inspiration quibble in prejudices?
</p>

<p>
I think, however, that shuddering at mediocrities is a grave error. Evil
is the monopoly of the few as well as genius. Hating and loving them are
luxuries. Therefore it is that this writing is not composed in the luxurious
spirit of <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. My opinion is not an inspired one, my emotion
is not an abandonment. I write with a photographic dispassion of the
three great divisions of mediocrity—Slobberdom, Sneerdom, and Boredom.
</p>

<p>
Slobbering is not an art and it is not an evil. It is not even important
except as an object of analysis. True, if encountered in print or in the flesh
it is likely to have a nauseous effect upon sensitive souls; but then one can
easily avoid encountering it. One does not, for instance, have to attend a
Walt Whitman dinner. When one hears that a Walt Whitman dinner is to
be given on a certain night in the Grand Pacific Hotel all one has to do to
remain happy and free from suffering is to stay at home. My friend K—— and
I went to a Walt Whitman dinner because we were young and curious and
hungry, and because Walt, after all, is a great artist.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-23" class="pagenum" title="23"></a>
The dinner proved to be like most dinners of its kind—a glorious opportunity
for saccharine drool at the expense of a great name. Appreciation
and love of an artist—a poet—are highly commendable qualities if practiced
in private, if put into proper print. It is the same as with love of a woman.
But to stand up in a public place, to shed tears of ecstasy, wave one’s arms,
pull at one’s hair and strike at one’s bosom—these are, as they always have
been, the slobbering methods of egotistical mediocrity. It is simply a prostituting
of the emotions.
</p>

<p>
Mediocrity is not insensible to art. It is very probable that the Rev.
Preston Bradley, who insists he is a reformed clergyman, really likes Walt
Whitman, feels thrilled with the reading of him. But the joy the Rev. Bradley
derives from reading Walt in his library is not enough for him. In fact,
it is not a joy at all. It is an irritation. Give the Rev. Bradley an opportunity
to show what he thinks of Walt Whitman, to stand up on his feet
before three hundred and fifty sympathetic souls and prove what a keen
sense of taste and an advanced instinct of culture he (Rev. Bradley) possesses
by yawping:
</p>

<p>
“I love Whitman, I adore Whitman. He is this to me. He is that to
me—”
</p>

<p>
—then and not till then does the Rev. Bradley feel the real joy of appreciation
for “good old, dear old, wonderful old Walt.” Give the Rev. Bradley
a decent chance to platitudinize, attitudinize, and blatitudinize, and the love
he bears old Walt oozes from him in dewy sighs and briny words.
</p>

<p>
Do not imagine that I am violently indignant with the Rev. Bradley, or
wish the reader to be, for his insincerity. It is indeed one of his best qualities.
By being insincere, by having no actual ground for his ecstacy, the
Rev. Bradley must, perforce, pay a great deal of attention to what he says.
He is free to pick out the best words, the best pose, the most arresting and
perhaps enlightening point of view. I say he is free to do this, but of course
he doesn’t. It is not the fault of his insincerity, however. If the Rev. Bradley
were an artist he would profit by it and be great. But why all this talk about
such a person as the Rev. Bradley? Surely not because he is deserving of
careful censure. The reason is that there were at least three hundred male
and female Rev. Bradleys listening to him, slobbering in silence.
</p>

<p>
And now the next division of mediocrity. Mr. Clarence Darrow was
another of the talkers. Mr. Darrow sneered. Mr. Darrow sneered at Homer,
Euripides, Shakespeare, Dante, Landor, Whittier, Tennyson, Milton, Kipling,
and Heine because they didn’t write as good old Walt wrote. Because they
wore fetters in their art and insisted on making the last word in the first
line rhyme with the last word in the third line. They were weak, ignoble
creatures, these copybook writers, said Mr. Darrow; they insisted on using
a singular subject with a singular predicate and believed that a violation of
such procedure was a sin. One of the things you learn in your school text
books on physics is that a gentleman by imposing a pencil-point before his
eye can obscure his vision of the Colossus. The idea seems apropos in the
<a id="page-24" class="pagenum" title="24"></a>
case of Mr. Darrow. Mr. Darrow by imposing his soul upon the figures
of the world’s big men can obscure them entirely for himself and evidently
his sympathizers. After he had concluded three hundred and fifty persons,
every one present so far as I could see except my friend K—— and myself,
stood up and sneered with Mr. Darrow. They passed him a rising resolution
of love and cheered him three times, omitting, however, the customary
tiger.
</p>

<p>
The greatest trouble with Mr. Darrow was his sincerity. He didn’t
slobber any more than a public speaker has to in order to have a public to
speak to. But his sneers were deep and earnest. They were entirely intellectual,
the intellectual essence of mediocrity. All of us sneer, of course. The
sneer is the one great American characteristic. When I told a man in the
office in which I work that I had attended a Walt Whitman dinner he sneered
at me.
</p>

<p>
“Fourflushers,” he said. “I can’t see how you put that highbrow stuff
over. A lot of long-haired, flea-ridden radicals, ain’t I right? I wouldn’t
let my wife associate with a bunch like that.”
</p>

<p>
(This is my office friend’s highest conception of manly virtue,—a thoroughly
American one,—being careful of whom his wife associates with.)
</p>

<p>
Then my office friend went on to assert that Whitman was undoubtedly
an immoral, not to say degenerate, party, that he “got by with his stuff because
it was raw,” and that everybody who professed any admiration for him
was a suspicious character and one he “would think twice about before inviting
to his home” (where his wife is).
</p>

<p>
It is rather a complicated matter, this sneering business; and after attending
a Walt Whitman dinner I don’t know whose sneers disgust me more,
Mr. Darrow’s or my friend’s. They are both, however, identical in spirit,
the spirit of mediocrity and sincerity when sincerity becomes, as it most
always does, the cloak for ignorant convictions and bigoted fanaticism.
</p>

<p>
And now we come to the third and last condition—boredom. Among
the speakers at this memorable dinner was Mr. Llewellyn Jones. Mr. Jones
is a critic of literature by profession if not qualification—although I do not
say it, really. Of all the orators at good old Walt’s memorial gabfest Mr.
Jones was the least offensive. He said nothing that shocked the taste or
violated one’s innerself or harrowed one’s soul. I don’t, of course, remember
what Mr. Jones did say. One never does, not only in the case of Mr. Jones
but in the thousands like him. They occupy time and space and leave them
empty. Not for them the sneer or the slobber. Mr. Jones wouldn’t sneer
for the world. And as for slobbering Mr. Jones has too much good taste
and discretion for that. Not that he is above them. His fear of them, his
apparent uncertainty in distinguishing between these two characteristics and
the characteristics of inspired opinion, indicate this plainly enough.
</p>

<p>
So to be safe Mr. Jones resorts to the time-honored entrenchment of
mediocrity. He barricades himself behind the bulwarks of boredom. He discharges
no cannon, he commits no sins, he makes no false steps or takes no
<a id="page-25" class="pagenum" title="25"></a>
false flights. He is boredom incarnate, the eternal convention in the arts
whether he deals with Nihilism, radicalism, or stands pat on the isms of the
past. Mr. Jones never gets anywhere, I repeat. I speak of all the Joneses.
Nobody derives anything from him—from them—except ennui. He, they,
never offend, never elate. He, they, are always Mr. Jones.
</p>

<p>
Listening to the Joneses is as elevating an experience as watching the
water blop-blop out of the kitchen hydrant. And this idea leads me back to
where I started—<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>.
</p>

<p>
Can you imagine what a thorough contempt a kitchen hydrant would
have for a fountain rising from the rocks, for a brook gurgling down the
hillside, or a strong river capering to sea? It wouldn’t exactly sneer at them.
Mr. Jones doesn’t. But it would feel moved to spirited reproof. How juvenile
it is to gurgle, the hydrant would say, how vain and foolish it is to rise
from the rocks, how upsetting it is to be continually capering to sea. I do
not claim any super-intelligence in the matter of hydrants. But Mr. Jones
and all the Joneses do say, and I have enough intelligence to understand
them if not to sympathize with them, that <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> is young and
idiotic and given to unnecessary emotions and so forth. All of which is true,
looked at from the elevation of a kitchen sink. “Why don’t you,” remonstrates
the hydrant to the brook, “blop blop with me?”
</p>

<p>
An afterthought: at this Whitman dinner there was one among the
speakers who sustained a dying faith in Walt, humanity, and <em>vers libre</em> in
general. He was Carl Sandburg who read a free verse poem of his own on
Billy Sunday.

The Death of Anton Tarasovitch
</h2>

<p class="subt">
A Short Story of the Present War
</p>

<p class="aut">
<span class="smallcaps">Florence Kiper Frank</span>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">nton</span> Tarasovitch lay dying. He lay in a pleasant cornfield
whither he had dragged himself in the heat of the afternoon, for a
shelter against the merciless sun. But now it was evening and the stars were
out, and dying was not now so bad an affair as it had been in the dust and
the blinding sunlight. True, the pain was at times terrible, but at other
times it made one only light-headed, so that oneself or the part that was
Anton Tarasovitch seemed to be a different thing altogether from the body
of Anton Tarasovitch which lay beneath It shot to pieces, while It fluttered
and hovered above.
</p>

<p>
He had not been lying for many hours in the Austrian cornfield. He
knew that by the progress of the sun downward—downward until it made
the long summer shadows that he loved in the fields at home; downward until
it brought a breath of coolness and a gray light that had brushed out the
clear distinction of shadows and sunlight; downward until it was gone forever
and a few stars burned quietly in the sky overhead. It was the last
sunset that Anton Tarasovitch was to see in this world. But time had no
longer any meaning for Anton Tarasovitch. Lying on one’s back, so, and
waiting to die, a minute can seem all there is of the world, and then an hour
can be burned up like a minute, while one faints into unconsciousness, before
one is slowly dragged back again to the thought, “I am I”—the thought that
makes the world for each man, that creates for him the stars and the shadows
and the sun sinking downward.
</p>

<p>
Yes, Anton Tarasovitch knew that now—that it was this thought that
made the world. And when he stopped thinking it, the world would again
be nothing. Down! down! down! one would plunge, and then the world
would be nothing. But it would exist still for other men. Yet how could
that be? Tomorrow the sun would come up again into the sky just as every
day it had come up in the fields at home, making the long shadows that he
had so loved in the mornings and in the evenings. Tomorrow other men
would see the sun—many other men would see it. But if Anton Tarasovitch
did not see it——! In vain he struggled to create for himself a universe in
which there would be no Anton Tarasovitch. Well, he was not clever
enough to understand such matters. Men in universities and men who wrote
books had figured them out and knew all about them. But how was he, who
had never been to a University, who had not been to school even, to understand!
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-27" class="pagenum" title="27"></a>
Yet this much he understood—that he was dying for his country. This
the general had told them, and he had known always, since a boy, that it was
a brave and fine thing to fight for one’s country and to die if need be. Anton
Tarasovitch was dying that his country might be saved.
</p>

<p>
Yet it was strange that the big Russia had need of him, just one common
peasant. The great Russia had so many men that were strong and powerful,
men with uniforms that glittered—men that were much cleverer and braver
than Anton. Why should the country have need of him? Sasha needed him,
and the children. Sasha needed him in the fields and she needed him in her
heart too. She had often called him the light of her heart, in the strange
words—so different from the words of other women—that Sasha often used.
And he knew by her face that she needed him. She didn’t have to tell him
so. He knew by the kindling of her face, as of a curtain behind which suddenly
a candle appears. So her face would light up when she saw him. Sasha
would mind greatly if she never saw him again.
</p>

<p>
He was dying because it was a glorious thing to die for one’s country—for
the White Tsar, the little Father. You died to protect your country, so
that your great country might live forever. But if you weren’t there to
know that it lived forever!—now why couldn’t he think of the world without
Anton Tarasovitch in it? Why did he land against a black wall every time
he tried to think of tomorrow without Anton Tarasovitch?
</p>

<p>
It was needful that he die to save his country. What if, to the general,
he <em>were</em> only one of thousands and to Sasha and the children all of life—nevertheless,
if every man should think that, then there would be no one at all
to save the country. It was rather clever of him to figure it out so, especially
with the fire in his side that made his head so light and his thoughts fly off
from it and refuse to anchor down for more than a minute. It was clever of
him to reason it out—Anton Tarasovitch who had never been to a University—that
if every man should say to himself, “O, I don’t count. Just one more
or less!”—then there would be no army at all to fight the Tsar’s battles.
</p>

<p>
Yet he was not fighting or dying now to save Sasha. Nor was he dying
to save his children even in the years to come. That wouldn’t be bad—to
die so that years afterwards, even though it might be many years afterwards,
one’s children would prosper and would live more happily. That would be
a sort of living when one was dead, because one’s children were in a way
oneself in different bodies. But he couldn’t see how Maxim and Ignat and
Sofya and Tatya would at any time be better off because he was dying right
now. He couldn’t see but that the land would be poorer and that they would
have to work harder because he and the other peasants were dying for the
Little Father and for their country.
</p>

<p>
But if he couldn’t figure out just what people he was saving, at least he
knew against what men he was fighting. He was fighting against the Austrians.
The Austrians were a horrible people who spoke a language one couldn’t
understand at all. When you tried to understand them, you couldn’t understand
a word they were saying. He had known an Austrian once—a big
<a id="page-28" class="pagenum" title="28"></a>
blonde fellow who had stayed a few days at their little village. One day
Anton had been walking with the tiny Tatya on the road that led to the market
and they had met the Austrian, who had stopped and had given Tatya
a flower out of his button-hole. Anton remembered Tatya’s crows of delight.
The Austrian had smiled at her, a nice, friendly smile, and Tatya had grabbed
for his hand as children will, even when the people they grab at are
Austrians.
</p>

<p>
Tatya had seemed to like the Austrian. And Anton had had to confess
to himself that he wasn’t a bad fellow. But he must have been pleasant only
because of Tatya. No one could help being pleasant to Tatya. The Austrian
had been for a moment friendly because of her. At heart he was a hateful
fellow. All Austrians were hateful. They all hated the Tsar and the Fatherland
and they all hated him, Anton, because he was a Russian.
</p>

<p>
There must be some Austrians lying in this cornfield now, wounded as
he was wounded. But he could see no one. Flat on his back, he could see
only the stars which were thick now against the sky. And he began to
think that this was a cruel thing—that a man should be alone when he was
dying. Even when a chap was just ill, he wanted someone to take care of
him. Once when Anton had been ill of a fever he had been just like a baby,
so weak and helpless. He had cried then because the milk that Sasha had
brought him had been too hot for his tongue and had burned him. It was
silly for a big man to cry, but that was the way you became when you were
sick—weak and silly. He had never in his life cried when he was well.
When men were well they were never silly.
</p>

<p>
Women—women were different! Five times had Sasha been so ill that
it was terrible—four times for the children that were living and once for
the little one that had died. Sasha had almost died too that time. She had
been so white and so hopeless looking for weeks after! But in all the times
she was ill she had not complained as much as he had, that one month that
he was sick with the fever. That must be because women were used to pain.
The good God had so ordained it. For every life that they brought into the
world they had to suffer, not only at the time, but for months before and then
for years afterward.
</p>

<p>
They were strange creatures, were women. If a child became ill or died,
its mother suffered again, just as the day she had borne him. At least so
Sasha had suffered when the baby had died—and other women that he had
seen in the village.
</p>

<p>
Birth was a strange thing now! He had never really thought of it before,
but wasn’t it a strange thing that each time a person was born into the world,
there should be pain and the long months of waiting. Then in one second an
Austrian shell could blow away the body that some woman had waited for and
had carried in her own body. In one second—why, so he had been waited for—he,
Anton Tarasovitch. Now wasn’t that wonderful!—and he had never
until this minute really thought of it. He, Anton Tarasovitch, had been carried
in the body of his mother and had been born in pain and in rejoicing.
<a id="page-29" class="pagenum" title="29"></a>
Why, it was like a miracle! And he had thought so lightly of it, had just taken
it for granted that he should be born and that she should love him.
</p>

<p>
He would like to make it up to her in some way now. But it was too
late. She had been dead for very many years now and he also was dying.
Well, he could tell her about it when he saw her with the saints in Heaven.
</p>

<p>
Heaven! He would go there, of course, because he had always, since
a boy, been obedient and had done just what the priests had told him. He
ought to think now about Heaven. But somehow he did not care to think
about it, and the strange part was that it did not trouble him that he did not
care. Even if he woke tomorrow in Heaven, he would not be the same
Anton. He might live forever, but that wouldn’t be the same thing as
waking up in the morning with Sasha at his side. He tried to think what
“forever” meant, and he fetched up against the same black wall that he
had when he had tried to think of a world without Anton Tarasovitch to
know himself in it. Forever! ever! ever! No stopping! On and on! But
that would be horrible. No! no! he couldn’t bear that. One could do nothing,
nothing, to get out of it. Even if one could be blown to pieces with a
gun, say a thousand years from now, in Heaven, one’s soul would gather
itself together again and go on and on, forever and forever.
</p>

<p>
No, he mustn’t think about it. If he thought about it any more, he
would lift his hands and strangle himself, so as to be able to stop thinking
about it. Now he would think about Sasha. When he thought about her,
he could feel her right next to him. He couldn’t see her face exactly, nor
could he see her standing there. And yet it was as if she really <em>were</em> there,
and he <em>could</em> see her. That was the way it was when you loved a person.
She was, as it were, in you, or at least right next to you, and yet she was
separate from you, too.
</p>

<p>
He had liked life with Sasha. He didn’t know until now how much he
had liked it. True, it was a hard life they had lived together. One was
on the go every minute—in bad weather when the frost stung and to walk
even a mile became an agony; and in good weather one was constantly on
the go, when it might perhaps have been pleasant to sit under the trees and
play with the children. But life was good, for all that. Of course, if they
could have saved money—only a little money—it would have been better.
But the little money they could save had had to go for the taxes. The taxes
were for the Fatherland, the priest had told him. The taxes were paid
so that when the need came, Anton would be able to die for his country.
But there was something confusing about that. Life would be better if it
were not for the taxes, and the taxes were paid so that he might—no,
that was bewildering. With the fire in one’s side and in one’s brain, how
could one think clearly about so difficult a matter? Besides, there were
many matters of that sort that he, Anton Tarasovitch, was not clever enough
to think about. One left such things to the priests, who were good men,
and to the clever men at the universities.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-30" class="pagenum" title="30"></a>
The stars were sometimes a long way off now and sometimes very
near to him. But neither near nor far away did they seem to care about
him. They were the only things he could see in the world and they did
not seem to care about him. Undoubtedly they had seen many men dying.
He knew about the stars! A young teacher who had come to the village
when he was a boy had talked about them and Anton had never forgotten.
</p>

<p>
The young teacher had not stayed long in the village. He was “dangerous,”
they said, and Anton heard afterwards that he had gone to America.
It gave one many thoughts to listen to the teacher. He had said that
the stars were worlds, just like our own earth—the earth that Anton knew
the good Christ had come down to save. Anton, who was just a boy, had
wanted to ask him if Christ had had to save all these worlds that were
stars. But that was only one of the many confusing thoughts one had
in listening to the young teacher. One felt strange in listening to him, as
if the world weren’t solid at all, but were flowing like a river. * * *
</p>

<p>
Anton felt very sorry for himself, lying there under the stars that did
not care for him. He began to cry—silly, weak tears that tasted of salt as
they touched his mouth. It was only at times that he knew that he was
crying. At other times the soul of him entirely left his body and went
shooting up and up, to be recaptured only with a struggle.
</p>

<p>
The two of them—the burning body and the light soul—would have
held together better, he knew, if someone could grip his hand tightly. At
least that was the way they had done in the fever. When Sasha had
gripped his hand, as if by a miracle he had been restored for a moment
to a complete man, and was no longer two pieces—a body below and a soul
that went fluttering above it.
</p>

<p>
If only he could touch someone’s hand now—anyone’s hand—the hand
of a human being! To be all alone with the cruel, flickering stars up above,
that was no way to die—snuffed out into the darkness. That was no way
for any man to go, even though he <em>were</em> just a peasant. But Anton knew
himself important now, almost as important as a general. He knew himself
important, with a strange, tremendous importance. He was as important
as almost anyone in the world, and he was dying alone in the darkness.
</p>

<p>
Then he remembered that there must be other men in the cornfield.
He had thought of that before, and afterwards he had forgotten. If there
were other men here—even one other man, an enemy—he would find that
comrade and they would die together.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, painfully, inch by inch he dragged himself. The stalks were
like an impenetrable thicket. They entangled him as snares or a forest of
swords set about him. He dragged himself on his palms, inch by inch,
butting away the cornstalks.
</p>

<p>
An Austrian was lying on his back, gazing upward. He was dead now,
but Anton did not know it. There was a wound in his neck, and the flies
had begun to gather.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-31" class="pagenum" title="31"></a>
Anton gave a sob as he saw the Austrian. One more effort and he
would be near enough to touch him. Perhaps the Austrian would grip his
hand—hard—as Sasha had gripped it.
</p>

<p>
The hand of the Austrian did not grip hard when Anton touched it.
It fluttered a little, however—Anton was sure of that. So Anton covered
the hand with his own, and with his own hand gripped hard, as Sasha had
gripped the hand of Anton.
</p>

<p>
And so died Anton Tarasovitch, looking up at the stars.

Art as it appears without the artist, i. e., as a
body, an organization (the Prussian Officers’
Corps, the Order of the Jesuits). To what extent
is the artist merely a preliminary stage? The

<span class="firstchar">I</span> have lost patience: people are still asking “What does <span class="smallcaps">The
Little Review</span> stand for?” Since we have been so obscure—or
is it that people have been so dull?—I shall try to answer all
these plaintive queries in a sentence. May it be sufficient: I cannot
“explain” every day why the sunrise seems worth while or, as
Mr. Hecht would say, why the brook rises from the rocks.
</p>

<p>
<span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> is a magazine that believes in Life for
Art’s sake, in the Individual rather than in Incomplete people, in
an age of Imagination rather than of Reasonableness; a magazine
that believes in Ideas even if they are not Ultimate Conclusions, and
values its Ideals so greatly as to live them; a magazine interested in
Past, Present, and Future, but particularly in the New Hellenism;
a magazine written for Intelligent people who can Feel; whose
philosophy is Applied Anarchism, whose policy is a Will to Splendor
of Life, and whose function is—to express itself.

that time. I remember a few years ago in New York hearing an
interesting woman send a group of people into paroxysms by the
passionate childish seriousness with which she said, “I wish Anthony
Comstock would die!” Now that the government has accomplished
this desideratum, it is almost time for it to be congratulated. I
wonder how long it will be before this same government can “see
its way clear” to suppressing the agent provocateur and letting his
victims go free, or—well, never mind: it is beyond hoping.

<em>The Strike</em>

<span class="firstchar">A</span><span class="postfirstchar">nd</span> God said: “Let there be!” And there was.
</p>

<p>
And when the modern god, the omnipotent Proletariat, says:
“Let there not be!” ...
</p>

<p>
You say the strike of the Chicago car men is of purely local significance.
You crack jokes about the pleasure of walking and about
the adventure of jitney-rides. You are calm and complacent, you
blind and deaf men and women dancing on a dormant volcano.
</p>

<p>
You are right. Your complacency is justified. Why fear the
million-headed mule who has borne his yoke for centuries? He
grumbles?—Oh, it’s a trifle: just fill his flesh-pot, and he will take
up anew with bestial delight his eternal task of enriching the few
at the expense of his blood and marrow.
</p>

<p>
But fear the eruption of the volcano! For it will not remain
dormant forever. Have we not witnessed the spasmodic awakenings
of the giant? Recall the achievement of the Russian proletariat in
1905. Did it not wrest concessions from the obstinate Czar by
means of a passive revolution? Recall the general strike in Belgium.
Did it not cripple its commerce and industry for months?
</p>

<p>
The strike of the Chicago car men is pregnant with potentialities.
It is a symptom of a refreshing storm. Those who produce everything
and possess nothing have slept long in ignorance of their
power. But they are slowly awakening. And when they become
aware of the magic wand in their hand, whose passive motion can
stop the wheels of the universe.... Take heed, O merrymakers

<em>before</em> it can be judged as a work of art by issuing little four-page
leaflets containing portions of his work denied publication by the

Out of the young grass and silence you arise, frail bird,

flutterings of your wings.

Blaa-Blaa-Blaa

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">I</span> am sick of words—spoken words—verbal refuse thrown off by the mental
hypochondriacs who imagine themselves suffering from thought and
afflicted with ideas.
</p>

<p>
I am <a id="corr-17"></a>sick of the artificial inanities of the drawingroom—the polite
poppycock, the meaningless, emotionless enthusiasms. I often have entered
a room where male and female husks sat, their faces wreathed in empty
grimaces—animated masks discharging automatic phrases—and wished to
God I was dumb and could be forgiven for silence. Listening is not so bad
because one doesn’t have to listen.
</p>

<p>
I am sick of the salon-like groups who gather for the purpose of thinking
aloud and then forget to think and make up for it in noises. Monotonous
varieties, dropping pop-bottle gems from their lips, each individual
amusing and delighting himself beyond all understanding with his sterile
loquaciousness. Here in the salon groups, the discursive congregations
which come together in all manner of odd places and all manner of regular
places, garrulity approaches torture. Here the professional discourser
flops and waddles about in his own Utopia. He doesn’t crave understanding
but attention. As for truth, as for taking the pains to express his innermost
reactions to a subject, this is impossible. The discourser doesn’t know
what he thinks, doesn’t know what the truth is until he starts discoursing.
And then he discourses himself into a state of mind. I have heard him discourse
himself into the most startling convictions; into matrimony and out
of it into religion and out of it, into and out of every variety of damn-foolishness
imaginable.
</p>

<p>
Persons who use written words instead of spoken words as the parents
of their thought suffer from the same hypnosis. But in writing this is commendable.
It is commendable for a writer to be insincere if he can be more
logical and enlightening as a result. The result may be <em>De Profundis</em>
or <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. It is my notion that men are sincere only in their
<a id="page-42" class="pagenum" title="42"></a>
appetites. A man craves food and woman and other stimulants with unquestionable
sincerity. But in the realm of thought I have arrived at the
conclusion that sincerity is an inspired and not inspiring condition of the
mind.
</p>

<p>
I am sick of the blaa-blaaing hordes, from the smirking “supes” of the
let’s-adjourn-to-the-other-room species to the simpering cacophonists of the
<a id="corr-18"></a>Schöngeist nobility.
</p>

<p>
I am sick of the open mouths, the trailing sentences dying from weakness,
the painstaking use of wrong words and the painstaking use of correct
words; of the stagnated humor of deodorous sallies.
</p>

<p>
I am sick of the Argumentatives, people with an irritating command of
phrases, who balance paradoxes on their noses and talk backwards or upside
down with equal lucidity; who must be contradicted or they suffer; who
rumble bizarrely from the depths of every philosophical <a id="corr-19"></a>sub-cellar they can
ferret out in order to be startling; who shriek and howl and wail and protest
and—the Devil take them—tell the truth and make it impossible to believe.
Their only reason for talking is to impress. They are as noisy as cannon
and as effective as firecrackers.
</p>

<p>
I am sick of the delicate, searching souls who prick themselves with
their own words, who operate on fly specks, who grope and search and
struggle for fine and truthful things, who deal in verbal shadings intelligible
only to themselves—and then not for what they said but for what they meant
to say or desired to say or wouldn’t say for the world.
</p>

<p>
I am sick of their kinsmen, of the surgical tongues who dissect, <a id="corr-20"></a>who
vivisect and auto-sect.
</p>

<p>
I am sick most of all of my own talk. But I continue to talk. I talk
out of boredom and manage only to increase it. I talk out of vanity and
spread disillusionment. I talk out of love and have to apologize. A victim
of habit, I continue speaking, although I know the spoken word is the
true medium of misunderstanding. Words, words, they keep tumbling
out of my mouth and blowing away like dust before the wind. A pock on
them.
</p>

There have been revolutions in literature, authors have changed the
size and construction of the novel, publishers have changed the color of their
bindings, poets have changed the form of their poetry and the essence of
its style, thinkers even have altered slightly the trend of their thought.
Music, painting, decorating, carving—everything changes with time except
talk, which only increases. What a staggering illustration of the theory that
it is only the weak things which survive. For talk is the commonest of
weaknesses. Blaa, blaa, blaa—why not a revolution? What ails the radicals?
Do they not realize that the time is ripe? They have changed the
moral forms, the literary forms, why not the spoken forms? Why not a substitution
of expressive grunts and whoops and growls and chuckles and
groans and gurgles and whees and wows? Or is this matter one not for
the radical but for

The Nine!—Exhibit!
</h2>

</div>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar">S</span><span class="postfirstchar">ometime</span> in the winter a rumor got about that nine artists of Chicago
were to form themselves into a group and hold an independent exhibition.
</p>

<p>
At once the other artists were divided into two factions, those who
jeered and those who applauded, those who said unpleasant things and those
who had the enduring hope that at last something better was to be done in
our exhibitions.
</p>

<p>
The Great Nine, as the group began to be called—whether by themselves
or by others, it matters not: the phrase is a handicap—consists of
Frederic C. Bartlett, William Penhallow Henderson, Lawton Parker, Karl
Albert Buehr, Louis Betts, Charles Francis Browne, Ralph Clarkson, Wilson
Irvine, and Oliver Dennett Grover. They were too generous in their number.
Five, and there would have been no comment; nine, and there was aroused
indignation, criticism, and a “show us” spirit which should have put the
Nine on their mettle and made them give a stunning and silencing show.
</p>

<p>
On May thirteenth, after one postponement when expectation was tense,
the exhibition opened. What had we? A new setting and old stuff!
</p>

<p>
One of the East Galleries had been chosen. William P. Henderson
designed and executed the room. He made a piece of work having faults
but being the best thing about the exhibition, a contribution in itself. The
walls with their subtle color, divided into spaces by pilasters of deep wistaria,
red, and gold, rising on slender stems and blossoming out above; the
screen of red at one end with the Zettler torso against it—they complimented
themselves upon using this; the beautiful vases; and the green of the trees
made a room too obtrusive for pictures, or one in which pictures are intrusive.
</p>

<p>
Were the setting less self-sufficient, still there are many things to be
said. The sophisticated, almost exotic, color of the walls, emphasizing in
the work of some all that is crude and materialistic in execution or interpretation,
makes their work appear to less advantage than would the usual
bleak gallery. And why so many pictures? Why not one picture in each
space and that the best each artist could offer? How much more satisfactory
the room would then be. Anyone who follows exhibitions will agree
that each exhibitor has shown better work at other times.
</p>

<p>
Frederic Bartlett’s group is in many ways the best, and holds its own
in the room. Surpassingly beautiful in color are Mr. Henderson’s things.
The little nude is exquisite, but he should not easily be forgiven his portrait
of Florence Bradley, even if it is not meant as a character study. However,
he is one of the artists who can do more than put paint on canvas.
He can make Art in many ways, as men did in the “high white days” of art.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-44" class="pagenum" title="44"></a>
The artists themselves have seen from this first effort wherein they
have failed. This grouping must have been a very arbitrary one. Let us
hope that a group founded on mutual endeavor and on equal ability will
continue the effort to make our exhibitions comparable in some degree with
the best European efforts.
</p>

<p>
Chicago has now so many artists that it is impossible for them all to
be gathered into the old Chicago Society. There should be many societies.
Competition and co-operation among them would make the art life here less
anemic and super-sensitive and bigoted.

<p class="book">
<em>One Man, by Robert Steele.
New York: Mitchell Kennerley.</em>
</p>

<p class="first">
<span class="firstchar"><span class="prefirstchar">“</span>T</span><span class="postfirstchar">here</span> is nothing which reflects the smugness of a people so much as
the manner and temperament of its vice. And the temperament of American
vice is more distinctly and monotonously bourgeois than any of its virtues”—from
Ben Hecht’s “Phosphorescent Gleams” in the May <span class="smallcaps">Little Review</span>.
I have pondered over this maxim while reading Mr. Steele’s novel which
is hailed by the critics as “the essence of America.” The hero is essentially
American, horribly so. If the “average” type of any nation is repulsive,
the American “Average” is a thousandfold more so. For he is more petty
than vicious. The “one man” gives a confession of his life, full of puny
deeds, from committing petty larceny to “picking up” a girl in the street
and taking her to a “swell” hotel. The nauseating details have the flavor
of the adventure stories which you may hear at a gathering of travelling
salesmen in a provincial hotel lobby. What makes the boring Odyssey intolerably
loathsome is its note of syrupy Christian penitence which the hero
expresses after each penny-crime by falling on his knees and praying to
his convenient god for forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
The book has been hailed as a masterpiece. It is as far from a masterpiece
as a lewd “photo” is from art. The facts may be true, even autobiographical,
as some critics presume; the confessions will furnish good
material for Billy Sunday and his lesser brethren. But photography, even
if it be pornography, is not art. Let me quote the ever-new Edgar Poe:
“Art is the reproduction of what the Senses perceive in Nature through the
veil of the soul. The mere imitation, however accurate, of what <em>is</em> in Nature,
<a id="page-45" class="pagenum" title="45"></a>
entitles no man to the sacred name of ‘Artist.’ ... We can, at any
time, double the true beauty of an actual landscape by half closing our
eyes as we look at it. The naked Senses sometimes see too little—but then
<em>always</em> they see too much.” I blush at the necessity of digging up ancient
truths, but, my dear friends, read the reviews of Mr. Steele’s novel and you
will admit with me the crying need of teaching the American critics the
A-B-C of art.

The complete man must consist of three essential fundamentals—the
Artistic, the Intellectual, the Moral (mark the initials: aim!); man’s aim
should be the full expression of his tripartite nature; he must not leave out
any of the three sides, nor develop any one at the expense of the rest. Unfortunately
our age has achieved only two-thirds of the diagram, the I and
the M, remaining wretchedly poor in the A part. When we look back we
find that in the Renaissance period the A and I were overdeveloped, with
the total lack of the M side. The Middle Ages present the presence of A
and M and the absence of I. It is the Greek ideal we must look for in our
endeavor for the complete expression of man. The Greek gentleman, the

The evening had already passed when I returned home with
that hanging of Koyetsu’s chirography under my arm. “Put all
the gaslights out! Do you hear me? All the gaslights out! And
light all the candles you have!” I cried. The little hanging was
properly hanged at the “togonoma” when the candles were lighted,
whose world-old soft flame (wasn’t it singing the old song of
world-wearied heart?) allured my mind back, perhaps, to Koyetsu’s
age of four hundred years ago—to imagine myself to be a
waif of greyness like a famous tea-master, Rikiu or Enshu or,
again, Koyetsu, burying me in a little Abode of Fancy with a boiling
tea-kettle; through that smoke of candles hurrying like our
ephemeral lives, the characters of Koyetsu’s writing loomed with
the haunting charm of a ghost.

It is painful for me to stop quoting the religious ravings of dear
Noguchi. And all this pathos is about a bit of old Japanese writing! I can
<a id="page-46" class="pagenum" title="46"></a>
see the indignant Mr. Holborn’s moderate condemnation of the Oriental’s
unreserved passion, canting the cold-beautiful Μηδὲν ἄγαν (nothing
in excess). But, O forgive me, Olympian gods, I must come back to the
Burning Bush where Yone Noguchi worships Hashimoro, Hiroshige,
Kyosai, Tsukioka, Utamaro, and other such rhythmical names; I am aware
of the abyss of excess that yawns before me, but the exotic wine is so luring,
so intoxicating, the call of the Orient is so irresistible—I plunge:
</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
I will lay me down whenever I want to beautifully admire
Utamaro and spend half an hour with his lady (“Today I am with
her in silence of twilight eve, and am afraid she may vanish into
the mist”), in the room darkened by the candle-light (it is the
candle-light that darkens rather than lights); every book or picture
of Western origin (perhaps except a few reprints from Rossetti or
Whistler, which would not break the atmosphere altogether) should
be put aside. How can you place together in the same room
Utamaro’s women, for instance, with Millet’s pictures or Carpenter’s
<em>Towards Democracy</em>? The atmosphere I want to create should
be most impersonal, not touched or scarred by the sharpness of
modern individualism or personality, but eternally soft and grey;
under the soft grey atmosphere you would expect to see the sudden
swift emotion of love, pain or joy of life, that may come any
moment or may not come at all.

I recall an evening at “The Vagabonds,” where some ultra-modern
paintings were exhibited and bravely discussed. An idiotic friend of mine
suggested that the Vagabonds pass an evening in contemplating the canvasses
in absolute silence. The obliging chairman, who is a fair parliamentarian,
had the suggestion voted upon with the result of one vote in favor
of it. I recall that evening in connection with Noguchi’s lines about Koyetsu:

What need there be but prayer and silence? There is nothing
more petty, even vulgar, in the grey world of art and poetry,
than to have a too-close attachment to life and physical surroundings;
if our Orientalism may not tell you anything much, I think
it will teach you at least to soar out of your trivialism.

<span class="smallcaps">The Slav in Conrad</span>
</h3>

<p class="book">
<em>Victory, by Joseph Conrad.
New York: Doubleday, Page and Company.</em>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
The Slavs are not adventurous people in the Western sense of the word;
for the most part an inland race spread over the great monotonous Plain,
<a id="page-47" class="pagenum" title="47"></a>
they are inclined for melancholy introspective searchings and spiritual
struggles rather than for actual physical adventures. Their writers need
not create for their heroes an atmosphere of dizzying stunts and elemental
cataclysms; they find sufficient dramatic “plot” in the soul experiences of
the restless yearning men and women who dwell not on a South Sea island
but in ordinary cities and villages, fighting their human fights, wrestling
with God and man, gaining their ephemeral victories, but more often suffering
defeats. Yet, despite their lack of adventurousness, the stories of the
Russian and Polish writers, from Dostoevsky to Kuprin and from Orzezsko
to Zeromsky, have seldom caused a yawn in their reader.
</p>

<p>
The checkered life of Conrad has placed a distinct stamp upon his
works, distinct from both the writers of his race and from the Western
writers. We observe a dualism in his art, an eternal collision between fact
and fiction, between realism and symbolism. His inborn Slavic mysticism
is weighed down by the ballast of his rich experiences, and he continually
wavers between the Scylla of lyric melancholy and the Charybdis of picturesque
plot, preserving the equilibrium at times more and at times less skilfully.
The reader thus finds in Conrad that which he is after. For my
part, I am rather distracted by the over-complex plot of <em>Victory</em>; I should
much prefer to meet Heyst and Lena in less dizzy surroundings, for then
the interesting psychology of the quaint lovers would appear accentuated,
like the flame of a candle, and would not be blurred by a pyrotechnic mass
of startling coincidences and marvellous adventures. The atmosphere of
Doom that breathes throughout the story is reduced in the end to a sensational
Eugène Sue-like climax—a heap of dead bodies.

SICK IDEALISM

<p class="book">
<em>Erdgeist (Earth-Spirit): A Tragedy in Four Acts; Pandora’s Box, by Frank
Wedekind. New York: Albert and Charles Boni.</em>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Poor, foolish Frank Wedekind. Hapless Idealist. Luckless dreamer.
Have you read <em>Der Erdgeist</em> and <em>Pandora’s Box</em>? He wrote them—this
enfevered fancier. In two kindred flashes of madness he illuminated several
hundred sheets of paper and out of them—out of their blood-shot words
and illegitimate truths—a new figure is born for the bookshelf. Not an old
figure in new binding and fresh rouge. Not a Lescaut or a Thaïs or a
Nana. This mocking idealist of virtue removes indeed the eighth veil from
Salome. He hurls into the midst of the twittering parlor thinkers and sex
chatterers a most disturbing answer to the eternal question, “What is woman?”
It didn’t disturb me because I don’t believe it. And anyway, I don’t
mean that kind of disturbance. I mean, virtuous reader, it is impossible to
consume Wedekind without blushing. If you were disappointed in Shakespeare
and Balzac and Casanova and Jacques Tournebrouche and could find
<a id="page-48" class="pagenum" title="48"></a>
nothing to blush at in them, do not despair. Here is a fellow, this Wedekind,
who will daub a real blush out of a rouge pot, a miserable fellow
whom you can condemn and ostracize and, having relegated him to his
proper place, enjoy thoroughly or secretly or not at all.
</p>

<p>
It was Wedekind who first made people blush by a tasteless dissertation
on the ignorant smugness recognized by society as the proper state
for a young woman’s mind. He called it <em>Spring’s Awakening</em>. It was
chiefly instrumental in awakening theatrical writers and managers. They
spread the blush at $2 a head and waxed fat. But how did they spread
the blush? Did they talk like Wedekind did? Did the mawkish plagiarist
Cosmo Hamilton talk like Wedekind—tastelessly, vilely, brutally, and—horrors!—indelicately?
Not he. Mr. Hamilton and the other get-rich-quick
propagandists wouldn’t talk that way for the world. They are nice
gentlemen. Not for them the idealist’s leer. Rather the bathroom wink.
They will reveal a delicious girl in her delicious boudoir wearing a delicious
nightie. They will make her out a virtuous girl, charmingly endowed but
utterly stainless.
</p>

<p>
Having established this fact they roguishly introduce into her boudoir
an estimable young man and permit him to caress her dramatically. But
the whole proceeding is stainless. It is drolly suggestive of unspeakable
things—see box office receipts. But suggestiveness is necessary to bring
home to people the blindness of virtue and the dangers that beset the underpaid
young women who ignorantly make it its own reward—(if that means
anything). Anyway, when the audience leaves it has been enlightened.
Its taste has not been offended. Virtue has been shown to be a dangerous
thing—that is, uneducated virtue has. Everyone agrees. And if not they
disagree. In either case the discussion properly conducted (under the
auspices of the “Amalgamated Virgins of the 21st and 22nd Wards”) is
pleasing and improving. The press argues delicately and in good taste
about sex hygiene. A new physiology is placed in the public schools containing
information on the most effective way of brushing the teeth of the
young and preserving the hair of the old.
</p>

<p>
And last week Coroner Hoffman told me that it was impossible to estimate
how many girls were killed annually in Chicago by abortive operations.
He put the number in the hundreds. Hooray! Death is the wages
of sin.
</p>

<p>
But all quibbling aside, what does this low fellow Wedekind whom I
started out by calling an idealist (I will prove it shortly) do? To begin
with, he talks about sex. Not about stockings and undergarments and
perfumed kisses, ankles, asterisks and anomalies. Everyone knows that
this kind of talk, particularly when produced in drama form, is in the first
place inexcusable, and in the second place unnecessary, and in the third
place vulgar. And in the fourth place, instead of making the best of a bad
job—that is, making his contributions a mental stimulus for snickering roués
and ladies sensitive of their status—he insists upon being nasty without
<a id="page-49" class="pagenum" title="49"></a>
being covert. Is there anything more unpardonable? Nobody can enjoy
nastiness. The argument is an endless one. It leads to nothing except
blows or blushes.
</p>

<p>
As for the plays—I almost forgot I was reviewing them—Wedekind
explodes volcanically on the subject he treats, and blows the question mark
out of woman. He takes all the crimes a policeman ever heard of, rolls
them up in a package of soft warm flesh and labels it “Woman.” He
cracks his showman’s whip and calls attention to the texture of her skin
and the white meat of her body. And then he sends her forth to ruin, to
sweep like a polluted and wreck-strewn wave through life, breaking at last
in a dirty crest on a foreign shore and leaving a scum behind her. Are
these the worst things Wedekind could find to label woman—incest, butchery,
lecherous animalism, bloody business and abandonment? Who but a
sick idealist would pick a careless and care-free prostitute as a flaming example
of woman at her worst? And is the power to destroy the most terrible
power woman possesses?
</p>

<p>
Wedekind imagines that people idealize sex and hold it a beautiful
force. Poor Wedekind, where did he get such an idea? And then he
imagines that in reality sex passion is a smashing force that knocks people
into each other’s arms, tumbles their heavens, smears their lives. He
imagines that men and women love without thought, mate with the irresponsibility
of hyenas. And imagining all this Wedekind creates a sort
of droll fiend to prove it. Behold her—a creature to confound saints and
sinners, to tear the beauty out of men’s souls and dance with muddied feet
upon the finery of life. He dangles her before our eyes, naked and glorious—the
diseased siren of the ages. And he calls her Lulu, the earth spirit.
</p>

<p>
He introduces her fresh and joyous and vibrating with tabooed emotions.
She is in love with her own beauty. Her body thrills her with its
whiteness and its movement. She already has felt its power. Were I in
these plays I would as soon think of kissing Lulu as biting a stick of dynamite.
But I am not an ideal conception. There are other men—Wedekind
digs them up from every corner of life—who fall at her feet and who shoot
each other and themselves for the sake of being contaminated by her
caresses. Queer men, idealists. They tumble about her, whining, cursing,
chanting, forswearing their Gods, their souls and their vanities.
</p>

<p>
And she tumbles with them, from one precipice down to another, faithful
only to her nervous system. Her only virtue is a complete absence of
the quality. If only Wedekind had invested her with a single human moral
conviction—merely for the sake of completing her diabolically. If only
he had made it possible for her to sin against something. But she hasn’t
anything to sin against—not a conviction, not a moral. In this country
she would be tried for her murders and treasons and sent to an asylum for
incomplete people. What she does she does simply. When this hussy
kills the father who owned her in order to save herself from his threats
and then throws herself laughingly into the arms of the son, she does it all
<a id="page-50" class="pagenum" title="50"></a>
without malice. It is all natural, spontaneous. When she rebukes her own
father for making love to her (she tells him he’s getting too old for such
tricks), when she murders, deceives and pollutes she hasn’t any feeling of
doing wrong, any reaction except one of satisfaction. If this isn’t an ideal
I’d like to know what is. If everybody was like she is there would be no
sorrow or suffering in the world. We would all be simple animals dashing
around, biting each other, drinking from each other’s throats, feeling pain
only when our nerves were touched and joy only when our nerves were
touched. Wedekind imagines that this state is the true reflection of today.
He exaggerates what according to his experience may be a logical prejudice
and hurls it brutally behind the footlights and into the bookcase.
</p>

<p>
Lulu, bedraggled, walking the streets of London in the rain, looking
for prey, Lulu wheedling quarters out of ragged sensualists, hiding her
father and her lover and the woman who desires her while she “entertains”
her victims, Lulu spreading disease, and then Lulu running wildly around
the dirty garret in her chemise pursued and killed by a red-eyed, nail-bitten
Jack the Ripper—that is the end of woman. Poor Wedekind. What an
exaggerated opinion of virtue he must have,—an idealist’s. There is but
one more thing. It is Wedekind’s master stroke.
</p>

<p>
He introduces a note of unselfishness and poetry as a climax. Lulu
lies stabbed by the delighted and enthusiastic Ripper. And kneeling before
the picture of her in her hey-dey is the “Countess,” the woman who loved
her—a homo-sexualist—an irritating creature.
</p>

<p>
“I love you, you are the star in my heavens,” she cries purely. I don’t
remember whether the Ripper kills her or not. <em>What a mess!</em>

<em>Rabindranath Tagore: A Biographical Study, by Ernest Rhys.</em>
<em>New York: The Macmillan Company.</em>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Shrill Chicago and thousands of similar examples of Western civilization
have more to learn from a book of this sort than can be readily explained.
Taking Chicago as fairly representative of the swiftest modernity, one
must blush for the city of “I Will” whenever he picks up Ernest Rhys’s keen
and quiet study of the talked-about Hindu. The blushes are for the vast
herds whose only ventures upon new paths are to trample and set back,
whose only ideals center in or near the stomach. In the white light of
this book—reflected radiance from a first-magnitude luminary—Chicago
and her kind appear as blundering heedless egotists who never listen. Their
ears have not developed, their eyes are turned to the ground. “I Will”—what?
To grow strong, high-minded, clean of heart, and wise of soul?
Anything but this.
</p>

<p>
<a id="page-51" class="pagenum" title="51"></a>
Tagore, by his very tolerance and avoidance of condemnation, seems
vehemently to remind the thinker of all this—by force of the law of contrast.
The clear-eyed Easterner even points out a scant virtue or two in
Western civilization, such as the value of mastering materials, which the
Westerner himself overlooks when in self-defense; and no blame is placed
on the feverish civilizees. Tagore moves in a state of peace which is the
very essence of activity, and has no part in the fanatics’ plan which begins
with lassitude and ends in stagnation. He is a man of action, forceful,
definite, wasting no energy nor sparing the use of it. Modern methods of
doing things and “getting there” become mere feeble noises by comparison.
This is not the tragedy, that Westerners blunder and fail,—the East has
its failures,—but it lies in the fact that America arrogantly chooses not to
listen, not to see and learn. A few scattered listeners must catch the harmonies
intended for a whole nation, the majority having been sophisticated
to extinction. The herds in Chicago and elsewhere will go on indefinitely
in their own swaggering way, blind and deaf, sure beyond correction that
the chief desirability lies in digestion, decoration, and diversion ...
while Rabindranath Tagore and the beautiful element he personifies are
ever-present, waiting within reach of all, working out the biggest things in
the world, and living the last word of true joy.
</p>

<p>
Ernest Rhys is very gentle and sparing in making comparisons. He
leaves this to his reader, and is mainly occupied with the re-creation of the
steady magnetic atmosphere which is a natural attribute of Tagore. The
paragraphs devoted to the boys’ school at Bolpur give one a feeling of
something lost, at least to those who thirsted through the schools of the
U. S. Rhys is successful in giving out an excellent idea of the great man
and his works.

<div class="excerpt">
<p class="noindent">
During the past ten months the German Ambassador
at Washington has done nothing to promote a better
understanding between his own government and nation
and the American government and nation. He is consequently
all the more to be congratulated upon his behavior
at a moment of acute and dangerous contention
between the United States and Germany. He has on his
own initiative and perhaps at his own risk intervened on
behalf of a possibly peaceful solution of the differences
between the two governments. He has sought by means
of a frank talk with President Wilson to break through
the barrier of misunderstanding which the exchange of
notes was building up between the two governments and
to re-establish a genuine vehicle of communication. The
conversation may not lead to agreement, but at the top
of a peculiarly forbidding crisis it has at least made an
agreement seem not impossible. Everybody who detests
war, everybody who hopes that the friendship between
the United States and Germany will not be involved
in the wreckage of the hideous conflict, will be grateful
to Count von Bernstorff for his enterprise.

<em>Mrs. Jean Cowdrey Norton, Hempstead, Long Island</em>:
</p>

<p>
Since coming in contact with <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> last December, I have more than
enjoyed each issue with your own impulsive, warm-hearted, dauntless personality
coming through its pages; and it is for that reason I do not hesitate to ask you for
an explanation of a sentence that you wrote in the April number, which led me to
subscribe for that horrible output, viz., <em>The Masses</em>. You pronounced it indispensable
to intelligent living. On that I sent in a subscription, and whereas I am not so awfully
stupid I cannot understand how you, who are evidently an artist with high ideals,
could possibly have such a magazine on your desk. The cartoons are so untrue, so
damnably vulgar,—which good art never is,—the insistent harping on the shadows of
life, the exaggerated outlook which tinges the whole paper—quite as one-sided on its
side as other papers are on theirs; all of which I know must be in complete contradiction
to your self. It fills me with astonishment. We acknowledge with our ever-increasing
complex civilization that we must more than ever perhaps help each other;
but I don’t just understand which class this perfectly rotten sheet is intended to reach.
If it’s the so-called down trodden, they are apt to have so much unhappiness any way
I should say a good brace up does more good than harping on injustice in general;
as for the class that “does not think,” its inartistic drawings alone would be enough
to queer it. When I am down and out—I happen to be a working woman too—I most
decidedly <em>do not</em> want to be made more down and out by more woes, that often spring
from lack of intelligence, that both rich and poor suffer alike from. You will see I
believe in the responsibility of the individual, that you Socialists rather avoid. I do
not expect you to answer this letter, but I shall look in <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span> for a
stray line that will give me some idea of your outlook.
</p>

<p class="note">
[I have so much to say in answer to this letter, and
so little time to say it that I have asked someone who
shares my view to do it for me. Mr. Davis says it
much better than I could, anyhow. And I must add that
I am not a Socialist. I am an Anarchist—which means,
an Individualist; which means everything that people
think it doesn’t mean.—<em>The Editor.</em>]
</p>

<p class="from">
<em>F. Guy Davis, Chicago</em>:
</p>

<p>
I will try to indicate very briefly why I think so much of <em>The Masses</em>. The group
that is getting it out are real students who know the crowd with all its hope and
despair, much better than the crowd knows itself. They are interpreting the crowd.
The mass would never like <em>The Masses</em>. It is too true. It is not got up for them.
<em>The Cosmopolitan</em> is the ideal of the mass. <em>The Masses</em> is for the few brave spirits
who want to know life as it is, the shadows as well as the flights up into the sunshine.
<em>The Masses</em> to my mind has as broad a range of feeling reflected in its pages as any
magazine I know of. Humor, tragedy, light, shade, drama, color, yes, and mud too,
as you say. But isn’t mud a part of life? In some respects mud is the condition of
life. The great need of the sensitive mind of today is contact with the vital life-giving
things and ideas which come from the earth. The life of such a mind is like
the life of a plant. Its roots must go down beneath the surface or it will die. <em>The
Masses</em> to my mind is the spirit of the earth put into magazine form, and to read it
understandingly is to put the roots of the soul down into the earth where they should
be if a healthy growth is desired. One could get too much of that contact of course,
but that is another matter.

<em>FREE POETS v. FREE VERSE.</em>

[As Mr. Carter suggests in the following letter, reprinted
from <em>The Egoist</em>, I hope <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>
agree with Mr. Aldington’s point of view. I hope the latter
may be induced to answer Mr. Carter at length in the

</p>

<p class="from">
<em>To the Editor, The Egoist</em>
</p>

<p>
Madam,—I notice that in his contribution to the Imagist number of <em>The Egoist</em>
Mr. Harold Monro, writing on the history of the Imagist movement, states that the
movement owes its origin to the large discovery of “Poetry as <em>an</em> art” [my italics].
He then proceeds to point out that the Imagist verse fails as poetry not because the
writers love poetry less, but because they love expression more. Being what it is it
would be no better if Tennyson had written it, and no worse if it proved to be by, say,
Mr. Rudyard Kipling. Indeed, it is not poetry any more than little Congreve’s tiresome
stream of depreciation is comedy, despite what certain hopeless apprentice play
critics assert to the contrary. Poetry, I suppose Mr. Monro would say, is not expression
but the thing expressed. All this is good and true. But Mr. Monro fails to
make one thing quite clear. The Imagists have been mistaken in their very conception
of poetry which lives alone by the power to see it as Art and not as “<em>an art</em>.” I am
convinced that some at least of the Imagists are not without the secret of this power,
and if they will be guided by the vision they gain thereby, to the extent of forgetting
their literary erudition, it will transform their conception of poetry. The strict literature
at which they aim is not proper poetry. In fact, literary technicians do not, as a
rule, write poetry for the simple reason that even if they dream the poet’s dream of
reality they at once proceed to smother it under literary form. We must look to those
rich in poetical experience, and free to express it, for the true expression of poetry. In
plain words, “Poetry as <em>an</em> art” (that is, as expression or form) is not the same as
Poetry as Art (that is, the thing expressed). The distinction is so big and vital and
so necessary to be maintained at this moment, that I propose to consider it in an article
in <span class="smallcaps">The Little Review</span>. I hope to prove that what poetry needs nowadays is free
poets, not free verse.
</p>

<p class="sign">
<span class="smallcaps"><a id="corr-28"></a>Huntly Carter.</span>
</p>

<p class="note">
[As the nearest available Imagist, perhaps I may be permitted to comment (without
prejudice to the other Imagists) on Mr. Carter’s letter. I am not quite sure that I
know what Mr. Carter means, but I think he means that it is useless for a man to
study classic quantity and mediaeval rhyme and modern free verse, if he has no particular
impulse or mood to make those studies valuable as a means of expression. If
that is what Mr. Carter means I agree with him. I will also agree that it is useless
to try and teach a dumb man to lecture or a lame man to break the hundred yards
record. If a man is to lecture, if he is to be an athlete, we take for granted that in
the first case he has ideas and a certain eloquence, and in the second a good physique
and an aptitude for sprinting. Mr. Carter would be a rotten trainer if he didn’t make
his man diet, take cold baths and long walks and an occasional sprint; he ought even
to make him do a little boxing. I feel, somehow, that Mr. Carter never went in for
violent exercise or that he relied upon his “Soul-Flow” or “Art-Ebb” to get him
through.
</p>

<p class="note">
Now poetry is not so very unlike athletics. You may have no aptitude for it,
and then all the training in the world won’t get you in first; you may shape very well,
but if you don’t train you will be an “also ran.” I believe in having an aptitude and
in training it; Mr. Carter believes in having an aptitude and not training it.
</p>

<p class="note">
<a id="page-55" class="pagenum" title="55"></a>
I object to Mr. Carter informing us of the existence of our “of courses.” We
take for granted that a man is sincere, that he has lots of impulses and that he is
“free.” All that is the stuff out of which poetry is made. The making of it, the
“training” is what we are immediately interested in. We take for granted that we
have the essentials of poetry in us or we should not attempt to write it. We are now
after clarity of form, precision of expression. Mr. Carter, like the majority of our
fellow citizens, does not value these things; we find them present in every work of
art which is beautiful and permanently interesting; hence our anxiety to attain by
practice that clarity and that precision which practice alone can give.]

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
